# File-Metadata-Microservice
This is my code for the "File Metadata Microservice" project from the Free Code Camp Backend Certification.

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.

User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response.
